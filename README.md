# extraINSIGHT

## Description
A model for estimating the fraction of sites under strong negative selection by observing a depletion of rare variants within a set of genomic regions with respect to a neutral mutation model. This repository contains the pipeline for extacting the relevant data and fitting the neutral mutation model as well as the core extraINSIGHT model itself. This pipeline will eventually be available as a webserver from the Siepel Lab.
